          HOSTING Guideline
          
1. Use Environment Variables:
- Avoid hard-codes values in your code, like sensitive data, like api keys, personal data etc.

2. set secure response headers  -> https://helmetjs.github.io
- npm install helmet --save

var helmet =require('helmet');
 
 app.use(helmet());
 
3. Configure logging
4. Use SSL / TSL , important- but the most hoster make that for us
