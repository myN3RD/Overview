npm i kill-port

npx kill-port 443  (or whatever port is in the err)

WHEN USING EJS:

Error: Cannot find module 'ejs'

Go up one level (above app.js) and do npm install ejs. It will create a new node_modules folder and Express should find the module then.

*************
CORS


SOLUTION:
      (get req is failing)
      (browser console -> Netword Tab -> Response Headers -> look for 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin') -> If does NOT exist -> enable CORS on thge server


npm i cors

const cors = require(cors);

app.use(cors());  




???? app.use(cors({origin: 'https://foo.com'}));         tells the server to include the cors headers on every repsonse 



*************
COULDNT FIND THE DATA FROM .ENV FILE

SOLUTION: implement this line

app.js:
dotenv.config({ path: './config.env' });



*************
Error: Can't set headers after they are sent to the client

This happens when using two or more res 
-> its only alowed to make one res per ?function?

so, make sure just to use one res, the the err is gone
